# Beginner C Course Notes

## Summary

* This is all for my beginner C course and will be updated as the course unfolds.

## Notes

* Run DeBug = Fn + F5
* Run Build = Ctrl + Shift + B - When trying to run a build for a specific file, you must make sure the task.json file has been updated with the proper source in the args.  

* printf() - Prints the string inside
* scanf() - Can read a variety of formats. Simple constant strings you can specify with, %s %d %c %f and so on, to read strings, integers, characters or floats.
